# Distributed-Systems-Scratchpad

A system for experimenting with implementing distributed systems.

So far it includes:  
Processes, Channels, and Topologies  
Nodes that can be augmented with modules for encapsulating state and behavior  
Lamport clocks and vector clocks  
The Tarry algorithm for finding a spanning tree of a network  
The Chandy-Lamport snapshot algorithm
