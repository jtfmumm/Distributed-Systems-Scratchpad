# Distributed-Systems-Scratchpad

A system for experimenting with implementing distributed systems.

So far it includes:  
* Processes, Channels, and Topologies  
* A TopologyRunner that simulates time and concurrency
* Nodes that can be augmented with components for encapsulating state and behavior  
* Lamport clocks and vector clocks  
* The Tarry algorithm for finding a spanning tree of a network  
* The Chandy-Lamport snapshot algorithm  
* Simple broadcast (flooding) and echo algorithms
* A simple tester to check whether broadcast messages are delivered once and only once to each node
